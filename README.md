#  SwiftUI-BlendModeExamples
This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive cheat sheet for blend modes, a crucial aspect of computer graphics. The cheat sheet provides a quick reference guide for each blend mode, detailing their function and characteristics and practical examples of their use.

## Motivation
The documentation on blend modes is incomplete and fragmented across different sources. For instance, Appleâ€™s documentation on [Bitmap Images and Image Masks](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/drawingwithquartz2d/dq_images/dq_images.html) includes a section on using blend modes with images, but this information pertains to Quartz 2D rather than SwiftUI. Therefore, a comprehensive and up-to-date resource on blend modes specifically for SwiftUI is currently unavailable. And I want to fix it in this paper.

## Test code
```swift
var body: some View {
    sfImage("mountain.2.fill", .accentColor)
        .overlay(overlay.blendMode(blendMode))
        .compositingGroup()
}

var overlay: some View {
    VStack {
        sfImage("sun.max.fill", .orange)
        HStack {
            sfImage("tree.fill", .black)
            Spacer()
            sfImage("tree.fill", .white)
        }
    }
}

func sfImage(_ systemName: String, _ color: Color) -> some View {
    Image(systemName: systemName)
        .resizable()
        .scaledToFit()
        .foregroundColor(color)
}
```
## Example Usage
### Alpha relative
| Name | Description | Image |
| --- | --- | --- |
| .destinationOut | The destinationOut blend mode produces an output image with transparent overlapping areas by subtracting the source colour from the destination colour and taking the maximum value between the result and zero | ![Blend mode destinationOut](Examples/destinationOut.png)
| .sourceAtop | The sourceAtop blend mode produces an output image by drawing the source image on top of the destination image, but only in the areas where they overlap. | ![Blend mode sourceAtop](Examples/sourceAtop.png) |
